The MeerKAT python software package `katdal` uses native python libraries to improve access and
inspection of large MeerKAT files.    
Inspecting MeerKAT MVF observation data using the `katdal` software are therefore more efficient for
the larger files that first converting to CASA.

Similar to the CASA measurement sets, the MVF file format also contains all information related to an
observation, including observed data as well as telescope related metadata.    
The example notebooks illustrate interaction with MVF files to obtain information of interest.
